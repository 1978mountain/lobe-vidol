## ‚ú® Feature Overview

### `1`. **Text Chat Mode**

Streamed responses provide a smooth conversational experience, allowing you to create an immersive dialogue by setting up character dialogue scenarios.

<img width="1285" alt="fluent chat experience" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2585e90-b44e-494b-ac55-113f924abefc">

### `2`. **Video Chat Mode**

With the video button in the message box, you can engage in richer interactions with character models, such as face-to-face chats, character performances, and more. You can also set the background, stage, actions, and dances for the characters.

<img width="1285" alt="video chat experience" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4af0dfb3-97b9-468e-b1c9-a672242d8aad">

You can enhance the dialogue's context by setting background images:

<img width="1318" alt="background setting" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e62b635c-168d-4f4e-8741-39aac0f7cfd3">

With a built-in library of Mixamo character motions and poses, you can have characters strike the desired poses or perform actions during the conversation:

<img width="1323" alt="motions and postures" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95d9a42e-4215-45f2-8171-f631a91065c9">

Using the character editor, you can create your own virtual idol, set touch responses, upload VRM models to the site, and interact with them.

<img width="1291" alt="role edit" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d319554-ae14-4932-b527-e220c910fd51">

With the support of mmd-parser, you can dance with your favorite idols using vmd files; Just Dance!

<https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c017be86-dbac-4ce1-9f00-a10248b58621>

We have added stage loading features and built-in a variety of stage options, allowing characters to dance with different stage styles:

<img width="1317" alt="pmx stage" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec436b96-c270-431a-acef-f140584e6938">

By clicking on different body parts of the character, they will respond in various ways. You can also edit the character's touch responses to create unique interactive effects:

### `3`. **Multi-Model Provider Support**

<img width="1285" alt="multi model provider" src="https://oss.vidol.chat/docs/2024/12/7ae6ec6df8f75837f30204069b823736.png">

The diversity of model providers is crucial for meeting community needs when providing AI conversation services. Therefore, we have expanded our support to multiple model providers, rather than being limited to a single one, to offer users a richer and more diverse conversation selection. This way, LobeVidol can flexibly adapt to different user needs while providing developers with a broader range of options.

#### Supported Model Providers

We have implemented support for the following model providers:

### `4`. **Character and Dance Market**

The character market at LobeVidol brings together a variety of meticulously designed characters, allowing you to experience different scenarios and interactions, providing you with a unique companionship experience. Our market is not just a showcase platform; it is also a collaborative space where everyone can contribute their imagination and share their personally designed characters.

> \[!TIP]
>
> With the character creation feature, you can easily submit your character creations to our platform. We emphasize that LobeVidol has established a sophisticated automated internationalization (i18n) workflow, which seamlessly transforms your characters into multiple language versions. This means that regardless of the language your users speak, they can experience your characters without barriers.

<img width="1320" alt="discover" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f155227-6856-4957-9f6e-a9b3f534df24">

The dance market at LobeVidol is enriched with a variety of MMD dance resources, creating a rich visual experience. You can combine different characters, stages, music, and dances to create a unique viewing experience.

<img width="1323" alt="Snipaste_2024-11-05_21-22-47" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/684ba6ad-17a9-4af3-9943-fcaaee121216">

### `5`. **TTS & STT Voice Conversations**

LobeVidol supports Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) technologies, enabling our application to convert text information into clear voice output. Users can interact with our conversational assistant as if they were talking to a real person. Users can choose from a variety of voices to match their assistant with the appropriate sound source. Additionally, for those who prefer auditory learning or want to gather information while busy, TTS offers an excellent solution.

At LobeVidol, we have carefully selected a range of high-quality voice options (OpenAI Audio, Microsoft Edge Speech) to meet the needs of users from different regions and cultural backgrounds. Users can choose the appropriate voice based on personal preferences or specific scenarios, thus obtaining a personalized communication experience.

<div align="right">

[!\[\]\[back-to-top\]](#readme-top)

</div>

### `6`. **Progressive Web Application (PWA)**

We understand the importance of providing a seamless experience for users in today's multi-device environment. To this end, we have adopted Progressive Web Application [PWA](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361) technology, which elevates web applications to a near-native app experience. Through PWA, LobeVidol can deliver a highly optimized user experience on both desktop and mobile devices while maintaining lightweight and high-performance characteristics.

Visually and functionally, we have also designed it carefully to ensure that its interface is indistinguishable from native applications, providing smooth animations, responsive layouts, and adapting to different device screen resolutions.

> \[!NOTE]
>
> If you are unfamiliar with the PWA installation process, you can follow these steps to add LobeVidol as your desktop application (also applicable to mobile devices):
>
> - Run Chrome or Edge browser on your computer.
> - Visit the LobeVidol webpage.
> - Click the <kbd>Install</kbd> icon in the upper right corner of the address bar.
> - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the PWA installation.
